      <p>Beyond One was acquired by Beyond as an out of the box solution for their customer facing platform. The Beyond One platform included a plethora of features and already touted an impressive client base with the likes of Panera and El Pollo Loco. Initially hired as a Lead Architect, my role consisted of evaluating the Beyond One platform and continuing to aid in its success.</p>

      <p>Like most start-ups, my role wasn’t clearly defined. I was integral to the architecture planning design, development, as well as the servant leadership empowering the team to collaborate and challenge each other. Beyond’s Vice President of Delivery employed a culture of autonomy, which also meant a flat hierarchy and no Manager level employees. As the Lead Architect, I reported directly to the VP and provided the level of servant leadership that a Manager would provide. I performed regular one on ones with team members to understand their concerns, strengths and personalities so that we could best coalesce as a team. After a few months, my leadership skills were noticed and I was promoted to Solutions Architect. </p>
        
      <p>It took several months to understand the existing platform and features. Written in AngularJS, Angular and NodeJS, I was already in familiar territory. As we continued to learn more, we found that the existing architecture wasn’t completely inline with Beyond’s vision for the platform. After working with the DevOps team and the remote Beyond One team, we derived a plan to better align the Beyond One architecture. </p>
        
      <p>Coined the Micro-App Architecture, we developed a solution to inject the new architecture alongside the existing. It consisted of an API Gateway, Authorization Service and Single Page Apps, App APIs and GraphQL. This allowed us to build new applications in the platform using any development stack, no longer marrying us to any particular technology and successfully decoupling platform applications from the platform itself. Development experience sky-rocketed and performance benefits exponentially increased customer experience. We reaped all the benefits of the new architecture with virtually no downtime and complete backwards compatibility.</p>

Essentially the reincarnation of the previous company RxCrossroads, the CTO knew the technology at RxCrossroads no longer met the high standards for patient satisfaction. The decision was made early on to build the CRM from the ground up.</blockquote>

        <p>As a newly founded startup, roles were not clearly defined and responsibilities were spread thin. During the CRM project, I talked about growing as a leader alongside the development team. Once our platform was created, we started marketing our services and landing customers. This opened up another door for growth and opportunity. Our first client implementation was not the smoothest project, but after showing interest in a high level leadership role, I was assigned to our second client, Verastem.</p>
          
        <p>The role of Implementation Architect consisted of working directly with our Director of Client Solutions and the clients themselves to understand their technology needs. Once we understood the needs of the clients, I worked directly with the CTO, Product Owners, Engineers and QA to visualize, architect and execute an agile project plan. Still carrying the Lead Software Engineer title, I was also heavily involved in creating technical solutions, while also helping the team scope out deliverables.</p>
          
        <p>As I led the Verastem Implementation, I found that gaps in communication were spreading throughout the organization. There were assumptions made that affected critical decisions and could potentially delay the project. Our stakeholders and product owners identified additional services and enhancements that we could provide, but didn’t have a proper channel for these requests. Since my background was in Agile development, I played an integral role in defining our delivery processes, but working directly with external stakeholders and clients was relatively new for the team.</p> 
          
        <p>Following Agile and the Scrum framework, we planned our work using epics, features and stories, along with story pointing. Grooming and Iteration Planning were already part of our weekly rituals, but those meetings were too detailed for stakeholders.</p> 
          
        <p>We needed a process for stakeholders to submit requests, review them with the technical team and vet the eventual solution. We also need to know the priority and value of these requests from the business given the knowledge of the effort as defined by the technical team. Along with the team, we helped defined two additional processes, Epic Grooming and Epic Prioritization. These additional meetings helped solve the communication gaps and provide the team with better up front requirements.</p>
          
        <p>Even though I had been playing the role for already, PharmaCord noticed my drive for leadership and promoted me to Implementation Architect from Lead Software Engineer. My urge to improve our processes did not stop there. As a believer in Devops, we started to follow the Shift Left principles. We began streamlining our continuous integration and deployment so that developers could push changes quickly and have them tested faster. After each iteration, we demoed our deliverables with the client to ensure we built exactly what they were wanting, following the fail-fast mentality. This would allow us to change direction quickly without wasting effort.</p> 
          
        <p>These changes laid the foundation for our following clients and greatly improved our over cycle time, client satisfaction and delivery team experience. My role continued to expand, fulfilling the Team Lead, Delivery Manager, Lead Software Engineer, Scrum Master, and Implementation Architect roles. I never sought to create a distinction between my technical or managerial roles. I wanted to make an impact wherever I could be utilized.</p>

        <p>Starting as a 6 month contract-to-hire, I looked for opportunities to showcase my leadership and technical experience. I was involved in laying the ground floor and made key architectural decisions to help the platform scale for the foreseeable future.  As the team grew, we found room for improvement in our development and workflow processes. Instead of dealing with the inefficiencies, I helped foster ideation of better processes. </p>
        
        <p>Early on, code reusability and continuous integration wasn’t the main focus of the company. We worked incredibly fast to stand up the platform from nothing. As the code base grew, we started feeling the pains of technical debt and inefficient development patterns. At the time, we didn’t have an official team lead. I took it upon myself to start addressing these issues and worked one on one with other team members. Together, we identified anti-patterns, educated the team on design patterns and shared our knowledge through presentations. The CTO noticed my leadership skills and formally promoted me to Lead Software Engineer. </p>
        
        <p>As the team lead, I wanted to make tangible changes to improve our growing pains. Our main challenge was maintaining the code base for a custom multi-tenant platform using Angular and Java. We refactored all of initial code into a what was called core packages that each client code base would extend and overwrite. Each client became its own application.</p>
        
        <p>There were several key benefits to this approach: We didn’t have to maintain a single feature flagged code base and instead wrote custom functionality for each client in their own code base. This prevented any unintended changes to other clients. Next, it allowed us to independently deploy each client’s code base. Meaning that problems could be isolated and resolved without affecting other clients. Instead of deploying during a 3 hour window on Saturday, we started deploying multiple times per day with no downtime. </p>
        
        <p>Even with the streamlined development and deployments, our processes were still not perfect. The speed at which our CTO wanted deliverables was not maintainable from a timeline or quality standpoint. This issue was masked by the fact that our stakeholders were only internal, we had not landed our first client. Up until that point, everything had been test clients with test implementations. When the news broke that we officially had our first client, it started to expose gaps in our IT delivery process. As the team lead, I felt responsible for understanding how to solve the communication problem from IT and the stakeholders. </p>
        
        <p>During the first client implementation, I continued to fulfill my role as Lead Software Engineer. But, I had an urge to learn about the tasks involved in implementing a client. We saw firsthand the breakdown in our processes and the stress placed upon our initial Implementation Architect. I was able to learn from the mistakes and propose solutions to help resolve the gaps. Near the end of the first client implementation, I started taking more responsibility. When the first client went live, I was alongside the team solving issues as they arose, ensuring a successful launch. My drive for success did not go unnoticed, I was assigned to our second client, Verastem.</p>

        <p>One of the main business requirements at PharmaCord was an application to manage inbound and outbound phone calls in their call center within the in-house developed CRM. After evaluating the products from Genesys, we realized that none of their out of the box solutions gave us the customizability and integration with our platform. Again, we decided to build our version, but with a catch, no technical support from the company itself. This was mainly due to financial reasons, but put an incredible amount of pressure on myself.</p> 
        
        <p>As the newest member of the team and still considered a contractor, the task was up to me to analyze their web API’s and reverse engineer their existing web application and create a completely custom version that would live inside our custom CRM. Thankfully, Genesys was well documented, but, unfortunately, it was documented more for internal use and not intended for third-parties to develop their own implementation. Using bits and pieces of API documentation and process specifications, I started to construct our custom version of Genesys.</p> 
        
        <p>The Genesys API is a web-based API provides a real-time connections to events within their telephony based application using server-sent events. It was evident that state management was the highest priority for an application of this nature. We don’t want a user to place a customer on hold and inaccurately display the call state in the UI. Having worked with Redux in the past, I was very familiar with the concepts of state management. Angular promoted using NgRx, their port of Redux using observables in RxJs. I picked up the new library and ran. Within a few months, I understood every underlying concept in the Genesys API, even the undocumented ones.</p> 
        
        <p>The process was not optimal, but I was able to do all of the above. I successfully developed a one-off implementation of Genesys inside our in-house developed CRM. Case Managers could log into our CRM and take inbound/outbound calls, warm/cold transfer, put on hold and mute within the same application. We even went as far as using enabling a smart caller ID feature that tied the inbound phone number to the potential consumer in our CRM. I was teased amongst the team, because the application went out to production with virtually no bugs. My implementation of Genesys continues to power hundreds of concurrent users in  PharmaCord’s call center today.</p>

      <p>Restorative Justice Louisville is a non-profit organization that helps repair the damage from crime without offenders facing criminal charges. Initially focusing on juveniles, RJL has expanded their focus to Adults. RJL uses The Family Group Conference model, which is a decision-making meeting led by trained facilitators involving a face-to-face meeting for victims (or a victim representative) and offenders along with supporters from both sides.</p> 

      <p>My partnership with RJL started early in my college career. They were selected a program where teams competed to build a system that met their business needs. As the team lead, I worked with my colleagues and RJL to understand their problems and design the solution. At the end of the competition, my team prevailed. Our application was selected by RJL and implemented in production.</p> 
      
      <p>We developed a close relationship with RJL and continued to work closely over the years. As they continued to grow and technology kept moving forward, it became apparent that we needed to revisit the platform we created for the system. In an attempt to fund the re-platforming, I helped RJL create a proposal for the Community Foundation Grant, the largest grant in Louisville. Out of over 100 applicants, RJL was selected and received grant. Using the grant, we were able to purchase new infrastructure and fund the re-platform.</p>
      
      <p>Knowing the task was too large to handle on my own, I assembled a team of engineers. Using Agile and the Scrum framework, we worked closely with RJL to determine epics, features and stories. I served as leader, architect and engineer and held daily stand-ups to ensure we were building exactly what was necessary.</p> 
       
      <p>Built in Laravel (PHP) and Aurelia (JavaScript), MySQL, the new platform focused on solving exact issues, whether that was better data validations or scalability in general. Productivity and experience was enhanced because of the focus we placed on transforming the application into a single page app. We also built a completely custom reporting solution that allowed RJL to create annual reports with a few clicks. To this day, I continue to work with RJL to service their technology needs. </p>

        <p>Portfolio’s usually consist of projects and demonstrations, but rarely focus on the skillset of a good team member. Technical feats and displays of leadership are great, but a lack of healthy conflict resolution skills will affect any team at any level. Conflict is inevitable and it’s what truly defines the relationship between teams and the people on those teams. I’ve had my fair share of conflict and I believe learning how to navigate the probable dysfunctions of a team leads to cohesive, productive teams. Part of our culture at Beyond is sharing knowledge and our latest read was The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. We try to apply these principles to our daily lives.</p> 

        <p>At Beyond One, I’ve faced conflict in different dynamics and levels that I haven’t faced in the past. Part of the Beyond One team is fully remote and has been working on the platform well before they were acquired by Beyond. This meant that the culture, processes and ways of life were much different than the parent company. This caused unintended conflicts through misunderstandings, assumptions and just different ways of solving problems.</p> 
      
        <p>In one scenario, an assumption caused a conflict that didn’t set well with the remote team. Instead of becoming defensive, I helped the in-office team better understand everyone’s perspective. Some team members disagreed, but in order to prevent unhealthy conversations, we elected to promote healthy conflict. I challenged everyone to better understand the concerns and needs of other teams, and in doing so, we found that our conflicts were just misunderstandings. Even though it was uncomfortable, facing our conflict directly helped build trust between our teams and made us less fearful to do the same in the future.</p> 
        
        <p>Conflict will follow us wherever we go, but it’s our choice to define how we react. I have similar stories for every company I’ve worked for, but some outcomes weren’t as successful. We know mistakes will happen, but nothing is more important than learning from those mistakes.</p>

        <p>Although working at UPS was not as technical as my roles that followed, it was an experience that helped shape my outlook as leader, team member and as a person. After graduating from high school, I knew that college was the next step, but neither my parents or school guided me in that direction. I can count the number of students in my graduating class who went on to college on two hands.</p> 

        <p>Growing up in a lower middle class family, I didn’t have the wealth to easily transition to college. Hoping to be a first generation college student, I was determined to enroll and would not let the challenges become excuses. I found that UPS offered a program that paid for college in full for its employees. I applied the same day.</p> 
        
        <p>Of course, there was a catch. I had to work during the night and go to school during the day. At first, it wasn’t too challenging. My hours were short and freshman classes weren’t as demanding. I developed a great relationship with my manager and he sought to place me in a leadership position. Not long after, I was promoted to a Supervisor for the largest truck operation in the United States. </p>
        
          <p>Before I started, teamwork and morale were at an all-time low in my area and I was on a mission to change that. As a 20 year old leading a team of 20 year old UPS veterans, I wasn’t sure what our team dynamics would be. I knew that one key to a successful team is to find out what motivates each member of the team. During downtime, we would talk and learn more about each other. That allowed me to build close relationships with everyone, which led to a better work experience. 
        
          <p>The challenges we faced together helped define my approach to leadership, which is universal across industries. I have no ego and understand that trust is the foundation of successful teams. Those lessons have stayed with me throughout my career and continue to influence my decision making.</p>
